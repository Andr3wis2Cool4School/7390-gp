**This is a 7390 group project**
**We are using R**



## Details
**In the day 8/12/2020 We used Twitter API to scrapy 10000 tweets from twitter. `#Donaldtrump` and `#Joebiden` both 5000 tweets by using package called `twitteR`**

### In this `README file` I want to explain some part of our own code

**But first what is a `sentiment score`?**
The core idea of sentiment scores is to put the number of positive tweets in relation to the number of negative tweets. So the number of sentiment score will be in range of `50% positive` to `50% negative`.
